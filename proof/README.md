* [Forking.ec](./Forking.ec) - general forking lemma in the FRO setting (Forgetful Random Oracle), incl. property transfer
* [ForkingRO.ec](./ForkingRO.ec) - forking lemma in the LRO setting (Lazy Random Oracle)
* [Schnorr.ec](./Schnorr.ec) - application of the forking lemma to Schnorr signatures, proofs of EUF-KOA (Key-Only Attacks) and EUF-CMA (Chosen-Message Attacks) security
* [State.ec](./State.ec) - auxiliary results re. serialization of module state, helpful for proving that a concrete module is rewindable
* [Stopping.ec](./Stopping.ec) - definitions of stoppable modules (i.e., modules that can be stopped at an oracle query) and their execution
