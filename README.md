# Formalization of the Fiat-Shamir transformation in EasyCrypt

WIP

## Setup

The project is checked using [EasyCrypt 2025.03](https://github.com/EasyCrypt/easycrypt/releases/tag/r2025.03), see [CI setup](./.github/workflows/ci.yaml). Required SMT solvers can be found in [easycrypt.project](easycrypt.project). (Other versions may work as well. Or not.)
